AB  - Vulvodynia is a condition that occurs in 8-10% of women of all ages and is 
      characterized by pain at the vulva that is present during sexual and/or 
      non-sexual situations. Diagnosis is established through careful medical history 
      and pelvic examination, including the cotton-swab test. The onset and maintenance 
      of vulvodynia involves a complex interplay of peripheral and central pain 
      mechanisms, pelvic floor muscle and autonomic dysfunction, anxiety, depression 
      and childhood maltreatment as well as cognitive-affective, behavioural and 
      interpersonal factors. Given the absence of empirically supported treatment 
      guidelines, a stepwise approach of pelvic floor physical therapy and cognitive 
      behavioural therapy as well as medical management is suggested, with surgery as 
      the last option. Vulvodynia has a negative effect on the quality of life of women 
      and their partners, and imposes a profound personal and societal economic burden. 
      In addition, women with vulvodynia are more likely to report other chronic pain 
      conditions, which further alters their quality of life. Future efforts should aim 
      to increase girls', women's and healthcare professionals' education and awareness 
      of vulvodynia, phenotype different subgroups of women based on biopsychosocial 
      characteristics among more diverse samples, conduct longitudinal studies and 
      improve clinical trial designs.

AB  - Vulvodynia is a heterogenous, chronic pain condition of unknown etiology that 
      affects 7% to 15% of women. It affects sexual function and quality of life. 
      Vulvodynia can be primary or secondary, localized or generalized, and spontaneous 
      or provoked. Contributing factors for provoked vulvodynia might include 
      vulvovaginal infections, low estrogen states, and underlying anxiety disorder. 
      Generalized vulvodynia likely arises from underlying connective tissue or 
      neurological dysfunction. Vulvodynia treatment must be individualized on the 
      basis of the patient's presentation and physical examination findings. Surgical 
      excision of the vulvar vestibule has high success rates but other modalities 
      showing success include pelvic floor physical therapy and cognitive-behavioral 
      therapy.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Vulvodynia constitutes a highly prevalent form of sexual pain in 
      women, and current information regarding its assessment and treatment is needed. 
      AIM: To update the scientific evidence published in 2010, from the Third 
      International Consultation on Sexual Medicine, pertaining to the assessment and 
      treatment of women's sexual pain. METHODS: An expert committee, as part of the 
      Fourth International Consultation on Sexual Medicine, was comprised of 
      researchers and clinicians from biological and social science disciplines for the 
      review of the scientific evidence on the assessment and treatment of women's 
      genital pain. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A review of assessment and treatment 
      strategies involved in vulvodynia. RESULTS: We recommend the following treatments 
      for the management of vulvodynia: psychological interventions, pelvic floor 
      physical therapy, and vestibulectomy (for provoked vestibulodynia). We also 
      support the use of multidisciplinary treatment approaches for the management of 
      vulvodynia; however, more studies are needed to determine which components are 
      most important. We recommend waiting for more empirical evidence before 
      recommending alternative treatment options, anti-inflammatory agents, hormonal 
      agents, and anticonvulsant medications. Although we do not recommend lidocaine, 
      topical corticosteroids, or antidepressant medication for the management of 
      vulvodynia, we suggest that capsaicin, botulinum toxin, and interferon be 
      considered second-line avenues and that their recommendation be revisited once 
      further research is conducted. CONCLUSION: A comprehensive assessment is needed 
      to understand the pain experience of women presenting with vulvodynia. In 
      addition, treatment typically progresses from less invasive to more invasive, and 
      several treatment options are worth pursuing.

      Perspective.

LID - 6639
AB  - Vulvodynia is one the most common causes of pain during sexual intercourse in 
      premenopausal women. The burden of vulvodynia in a woman's life can be 
      devastating due to its consequences in the couple's sexuality and intimacy, in 
      activities of daily living, and psychological well-being. In recent decades, 
      there has been considerable progress in the understanding of vulvar pain. The 
      most significant change has been the differentiation of vulvar pain secondary to 
      pathology or disease from vulvodynia. However, although it is currently proposed 
      that vulvodynia should be considered as a primary chronic pain condition and, 
      therefore, without an obvious identifiable cause, it is still believed that 
      different inflammatory, genetic, hormonal, muscular factors, etc. may be involved 
      in its development. Advances in pain neuroscience and the central sensitization 
      paradigm have led to a new approach to vulvodynia from a neurobiological 
      perspective. It is proposed that vulvodynia should be understood as complex pain 
      without relevant nociception. Different clinical identifiers of vulvodynia are 
      presented from a neurobiological and psychosocial perspective. In this case, 
      strategies to modulate altered central pain processing is necessary, changing the 
      patient's erroneous cognitions about their pain, and also reducing fear 
      avoidance-behaviors and the disability of the patient.

AB  - Vulvodynia affects 7% of American women, yet clinicians often lack awareness of 
      its presentation. It is underdiagnosed and often misdiagnosed as vaginitis. The 
      etiology of vulvodynia remains unknown, making it difficult to identify or 
      develop effective treatment methods. The purpose of this article is to (1) review 
      the presentation and evaluation of vulvodynia, (2) review the research on 
      vulvodynia treatments, and (3) aid the clinician in the selection of vulvodynia 
      treatment methods. The level of evidence to support vulvodynia treatment varies 
      from case series to randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Oral desipramine with 5% 
      lidocaine cream, intravaginal diazepam tablets with intravaginal transcutaneous 
      electric nerve stimulation (TENS), botulinum toxin type A 50 units, enoxaparin 
      sodium subcutaneous injections, intravaginal TENS (as a single therapy), 
      multimodal physical therapy, overnight 5% lidocaine ointment, and acupuncture had 
      the highest level of evidence with at least one RCT or comparative effectiveness 
      trial. Pre to posttest reduction in vulvar pain and/or dyspareunia in non-RCT 
      studies included studies of gabapentin cream, amitriptyline cream, amitriptyline 
      with baclofen cream, up to 6 weeks' oral itraconazole therapy, multimodal 
      physical therapy, vaginal dilators, electromyography biofeedback, hypnotherapy, 
      cognitive behavioral therapy, cold knife vestibulectomy, and laser therapy. There 
      is a lack of rigorous RCTs with large sample sizes for the treatment of 
      vulvodynia, rendering it difficult to determine efficacy of most treatment 
      methods. Clinicians will be guided in the selection of best treatments for 
      vulvodynia that have the highest level of evidence and are least invasive.

AB  - Vulvar pain affects up to 20% of women at some point in their lives, and most 
      women with vulvar pain have associated pelvic floor impairments. Pelvic floor 
      dysfunction is associated with significant functional limitations in women by 
      causing painful intercourse and urinary, bowel, and sexual dysfunction. A quick 
      screening of the pelvic floor muscles can be performed in the gynecology office 
      and should be used when patients report symptoms of pelvic pain. It is now known 
      the vulvar pain syndromes are heterogeneous in origin; therefore, successful 
      treatment plans are multimodal and include physical therapy.

AB  - Vulvodynia, a chronic pain disorder, affects women throughout the lifespan. 
      Appropriate evaluation and diagnosis is necessary to enable effective management. 
      The etiology is considered multifactorial. Therapies include self-management, 
      nonpharmacologic, pharmacologic, and surgical. Vulvodynia can have a significant 
      impact upon a patient's quality of life. Emotional and psychological support is 
      invaluable. This article serves to give the primary gynecologist and practitioner 
      a basic framework with which to identify, diagnose, and begin treatment for such 
      patients as well as understanding for referral if necessary. The initial 
      evaluation and physical examination will be discussed in detail.

AB  - Vulvodynia is a pain syndrome affecting the vulva. It occurs in about 16% of 
      women at some time of their lives. The etiology of vulvodynia is still enigmatic 
      and is probably multifactorial-including physiological concerns (eg, pelvic floor 
      muscle dysfunction, neuropathic pain, and psychosocial) and sexual issues (eg, 
      anxiety and sexual dysfunction). Although it is a common syndrome, most patients 
      are neither correctly diagnosed nor treated. A diagnosis of vulvodynia is based 
      upon patient history and lack of physical findings upon careful examination. No 
      clinical or histological findings are present to aid in diagnosis. Most treatment 
      options for vulvodynia are neither well studied nor have an evidence base, 
      relying instead upon expert opinion, care provider experience, and use of data 
      from other pain syndromes. However, many patients show marked improvement after 
      physical therapy for the pelvic floor, medications for neuropathic pain, and 
      psychosexual therapy.

AB  - Vulvar pain and discomfort (vulvodynia) are common conditions that can have a 
      significant impact on a patient's quality of life. Vulvodynia is a difficult 
      condition to evaluate and treat. This article gives the primary gynecologist a 
      basic framework with which to identify, diagnose, and begin treatment for these 
      patients and refer if necessary. Initial evaluation and physical examination are 
      discussed in detail. Treatments ranging from self-management strategies to 
      nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies will be explored. Because vulvodynia 
      is a chronic pain disorder, diagnosis is the key to beginning treatment and 
      support for this patient population.

AB  - Vulvodynia is a genital pain syndrome occurring in 7% to 8% of women. Although 
      common, most practitioners are uncomfortable with the diagnosis and management of 
      these women's pain, and many believe this is psychologically based. 
      Multifactorial in origin, ubiquitous factors include pelvic floor muscle 
      abnormalities, neuropathic pain, anxiety, and primary or secondary sexual 
      dysfunction. Although there are many published studies on vulvodynia, quality 
      trials that evaluate therapy are lacking. However, experience suggests that most 
      patients are significantly improved with pelvic floor physical therapy, 
      medication for neuropathic pain, psychological support, and attention to sexual 
      function.
