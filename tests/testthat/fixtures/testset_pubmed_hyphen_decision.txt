AB  - A revolution in the science of emotion has emerged in recent decades, with the 
      potential to create a paradigm shift in decision theories. The research reveals 
      that emotions constitute potent, pervasive, predictable, sometimes harmful and 
      sometimes beneficial drivers of decision making. Across different domains, 
      important regularities appear in the mechanisms through which emotions influence 
      judgments and choices. We organize and analyze what has been learned from the 
      past 35 years of work on emotion and decision making. In so doing, we propose the 
      emotion-imbued choice model, which accounts for inputs from traditional rational 
      choice theory and from newer emotion research, synthesizing scientific models.

AB  - Shared decision making (SDM) is the state of the art for clinicians' 
      communication with patients and surrogate decision makers. SDM involves give and 
      take, in which all parties interact to maximize the autonomy of patients. In this 
      article I summarize the core steps of SDM and explore ways to use it to benefit 
      patients to the greatest extent. I review three articles included in this issue 
      of The Journal of Clinical Ethics that highlight additional approaches we can use 
      to help patients and parents to see what may be in their own or their child's 
      best interest. I describe how these approaches can be used in most other medical 
      fields. I explore ways to share information with patients that are outside the 
      usual scope of SDM. Finally, I discuss how we might look, together with patients, 
      at what all parties are feeling before we begin the process of SDM.

AB  - The science of judgment and decision making involves three interrelated forms of 
      research: analysis of the decisions people face, description of their natural 
      responses, and interventions meant to help them do better. After briefly 
      introducing the field's intellectual foundations, we review recent basic research 
      into the three core elements of decision making: judgment, or how people predict 
      the outcomes that will follow possible choices; preference, or how people weigh 
      those outcomes; and choice, or how people combine judgments and preferences to 
      reach a decision. We then review research into two potential sources of 
      behavioral heterogeneity: individual differences in decision-making competence 
      and developmental changes across the life span. Next, we illustrate applications 
      intended to improve individual and organizational decision making in health, 
      public policy, intelligence analysis, and risk management. We emphasize the 
      potential value of coupling analytical and behavioral research and having basic 
      and applied research inform one another.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Shared decision making is a means of translating evidence into 
      practice and facilitating patient-centred care by helping patients to become more 
      active in the decision-making process. Shared decision making is a collaborative 
      process that involves patients and clinicians making health-related decisions 
      after discussing the available options; the benefits and harms of each option; 
      and considering the patient's values, preferences, and personal circumstances. 
      METHODS: This paper describes what shared decision making is, why it is 
      important, when it is appropriate, and key elements. We report on physical 
      therapists' current use of and attitudes to shared decision making and explore 
      factors that influence its uptake. Lastly, we examine what is needed to promote 
      greater use of this approach. RESULTS: Key elements in the shared decision making 
      process are: identifying the problem that requires a decision; providing an 
      explanation of the health problem, including, where appropriate, the natural 
      history of the condition; discussing the available options and the potential 
      benefits and harms of each option; eliciting the patient's values, preferences, 
      and expectations; and assisting the patient to weigh up the options to reach an 
      informed decision. When applied in practice, shared decision making has been 
      found to improve patient-clinician communication; improve patients' accuracy of 
      their expectations of intervention benefits and harms, involvement in 
      decision-making, and feeling of being informed; and increase both patients' and 
      clinicians' satisfaction with care. CONCLUSION: Despite physical therapists' 
      enthusiasm for shared decision making, uptake of this approach has been slow. 
      Multi-level strategies and behaviour change are required to encourage and support 
      the sustainable incorporation of shared decision making in practice.

AB  - Cooperation has emerged as a fundamental characteristic of human society, and 
      many argue that this ability is the basis for the phenomenal development in our 
      capability as a species. When we focus our attention to the interactions that 
      occur in healthcare, we inevitably notice power asymmetry due to unequal 
      knowledge, experience, and status. However, as many have argued since the 1970s, 
      there is an ethical imperative to respect the agency of individuals, offer 
      information, collaborate, and support deliberation when difficult decisions 
      arise. This process is particularly important when reasonable alternative courses 
      of action exist and where the priorities and preferences of individuals would be 
      expected to sway such decisions. This position article argues that this process, 
      commonly described as shared decision making, involves work that is cognitive, 
      emotional, and relational, and, particularly if people are ill, should have the 
      underpinning goal of restoring autonomy. It covers the origin of the term and 
      describes the core components; it describes how to do the cognitive, emotional, 
      and relational work that is required, and offers a model to guide the process.

TI  - Shared decision making for adults with severe mental illness: A concept analysis.
PG  - e12365

LID - e12365
AB  - AIM: Shared decision making for adults with severe mental illness has 
      increasingly attracted attention. However, this concept has not been 
      comprehensively clarified. This review aimed to clarify a concept of shared 
      decision making for adults with severe mental illness such as schizophrenia, 
      depression, and bipolar disorder, and propose an adequate definition. METHODS: 
      Rodgers' evolutionary concept analysis was used. MEDLINE, PsychINFO, and CINAHL 
      were searched for articles written in English and published between 2010 and 
      November 2019. The search terms were "psychiatr*" or "mental" or "schizophren*" 
      or "depression" or "bipolar disorder", combined with "shared decision making". In 
      total, 70 articles met the inclusion criteria. An inductive approach was used to 
      identify themes and sub-themes related to shared decision making for adults with 
      severe mental illness. Surrogate terms and a definition of the concept were also 
      described. RESULTS: Four key attributes were identified: user-professional 
      relationship, communication process, user-friendly visualization, and broader 
      stakeholder approach. Communication process was the densest attribute, which 
      consisted of five phases: goal sharing, information sharing, deliberation, mutual 
      agreement, and follow-up. The antecedents as prominent predisposing factors were 
      long-term complex illness, power imbalance, global trend, users' desire, 
      concerns, and stigma. The consequences included decision-related outcomes, users' 
      changes, professionals' changes, and enhanced relationship. CONCLUSIONS: Shared 
      decision making for adults with severe mental illness is a communication process, 
      involving both user-friendly visualization techniques and broader stakeholders. 
      The process may overcome traditional power imbalance and encourage changes among 
      both users and professionals that could enhance the dyadic relationship.

AB  - The scientific study of animal affect (emotion) is an area of growing interest. 
      Whilst research on mechanism and causation has predominated, the study of 
      function is less advanced. This is not due to a lack of hypotheses; in both 
      humans and animals, affective states are frequently proposed to play a pivotal 
      role in coordinating adaptive responses and decisions. However, exactly how they 
      might do this (what processes might implement this function) is often left rather 
      vague. Here we propose a framework for integrating animal affect and 
      decision-making that is couched in modern decision theory and employs an 
      operational definition that aligns with dimensional concepts of core affect and 
      renders animal affect empirically tractable. We develop a model of how core 
      affect, including short-term (emotion-like) and longer-term (mood-like) states, 
      influence decision-making via processes that we label affective options, 
      affective predictions, and affective outcomes and which correspond to similar 
      concepts in schema of the links between human emotion and decision-making. Our 
      framework is generalisable across species and generates questions for future 
      research.

AB  - Shared Decision-Making in Preventive Activities Abstract. Shared Decision-Making 
      (SDM) is particularly useful in conditions where decisions are 
      preference-sensitive, i.e., where preferences and values of patients are crucial 
      for the further proceeding. This typically applies to conditions where the 
      potential benefit and the potential harm are similar. Preventive activities are 
      characterized by the fact that there is no current burden of disease and the 
      benefit to expect is far in the future. Therefore, it is preference-sensitive if 
      the current effort really pays off. The procedure of SDM in (preventive) 
      counselling can be classified into three steps: Team Talk, Option Talk and 
      Decision Talk. For every step, we present examples of how to talk. After an 
      overview of the current evidence, we present four examples of how to apply SDM in 
      preventive conditions: quit-smoking counselling, lifestyle coaching, vaccination 
      counselling and screening for cancer. Finally, we focus on the role of activated 
      patients and point out the opportunity for SDM during check-up examinations. For 
      all these implementation issues useful tools and links are presented. In summary, 
      important elements of SDM, such as patient centeredness, clarifying needs/goals 
      and shared responsibility, are crucial for the entire spectre of caring for 
      patients, not only for prevention.

TI  - Decision-making in chronic ecstasy users: a systematic review.
PG  - 34-44
LID - 10.1111/ejn.13480 [doi]
AB  - Different cognitive impairments have been reported as a result of long-term 
      MDMA/ecstasy use. Increased impulsivity and altered decision-making have been 
      shown to be associated with the development and maintenance of addictive 
      disorders pointing toward the necessity to understand a potential impairment of 
      decision-making due to MDMA use. Thus, assessing the long-term effects of MDMA is 
      crucial in order to evaluate its controversially discussed therapeutic use. The 
      aim of this systematic review was to summarize the scientific literature on 
      potential effects of chronic MDMA use on higher order decision-making processes 
      in humans. Therefore, a systematic search for controlled trials relevant to the 
      topic has been performed. Only studies using specific tasks on decision-making 
      were included that involved subjects in the drug-free interval with drug-naïve, 
      and/or polydrug control groups. A total of 12 studies could be identified that 
      met the inclusion criteria, all of which were cross-sectional studies. The 
      findings on decision-making disturbances in MDMA users were heterogeneous. Seven 
      studies reported increased risky decisions, whereas five studies did not find 
      MDMA-specific influences on decision-making. Increased impulsivity was observed 
      both in MDMA groups and in (poly)drug control groups in almost all studies. Thus, 
      the current state of research does not allow for the conclusion that long-term 
      use of MDMA affects decision-making behavior in general. More detailed 
      specifications as well as further investigations of the relevant processes are 
      needed. Significant tendencies toward risky decision-making among long-term MDMA 
      use have been observed, but need to be confirmed by studies using a longitudinal 
      design.

TI  - Group decision making under uncertain preferences: powered by AI, empowered by 
      AI.
PG  - 22-39
LID - 10.1111/nyas.14734 [doi]
AB  - Group decision making is an important, long-standing, and ubiquitous problem in 
      all societies, where collective decisions must be made by a group of agents 
      despite individual conflicting preferences. This has been a classical and active 
      topic for research in many disciplines, including economics, political science, 
      cognitive and behavioral sciences, statistics, mathematics, and computer science. 
      In this article, I survey some recent progress in theoretical, algorithmic, and 
      engineering work toward building AI-powered intelligent systems to help agents 
      make group decisions based on uncertain preferences; these systems leverage 
      principles, ideas, and methodologies from multiple disciplines. Empowered by AI, 
      group decision making can handle a broader range of situations at relatively 
      large scales.

TI  - Neural mechanisms of social learning and decision-making.
PG  - 897-910
LID - 10.1007/s11427-020-1833-8 [doi]
AB  - One of the hallmarks of human society is the ubiquitous interactions among 
      individuals. Indeed, a significant portion of human daily routine decision making 
      is socially related. Normative economic theory, namely game theory, has 
      prescribed the canonical decision strategy when "rational" social agents have 
      full information about the decision environment. In reality, however, social 
      decision is often influenced by the trait and state parameters of selves and 
      others. Therefore, understanding the cognitive and neural processes of inferring 
      the decision parameters is pivotal for social decision making. Recently, both 
      correlational and causal non-invasive neuroimaging studies have started to reveal 
      the critical neural computations underlying social learning and decision-making, 
      and highlighted the unique roles of "social" brain structures such as 
      temporal-parietal junction (TPJ) and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). Here 
      we review recent advances in social decision neuroscience and maintain the focus 
      on how the inference about others is dynamically acquired during social learning, 
      as well as how the prosocial (altruistic) behavior results from orchestrated 
      interactions of different brain regions specified under the social utility 
      framework. We conclude by emphasizing the importance of combining computational 
      decision theory with the identification of neural mechanisms that represent, 
      evaluate and integrate value related social information and generate decision 
      variables guiding behavioral output in the complex social environment.

TI  - Shared decision-making with adults transitioning to long-term care: A scoping 
      review.
PG  - e12518
LID - 10.1111/opn.12518 [doi]
LID - e12518
AB  - BACKGROUND: Transitions to long-term care are challenging for individuals and 
      often associated with a loss of autonomy. Positive experiences are noted, 
      especially when decisions involve the individual in a person-centred way which 
      are respectful of the person's human rights. One approach which facilitates 
      self-determination during a transitional period is shared decision-making, but 
      there is a lack of clarity on the nature and extent of research evidence in this 
      area. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this scoping review is to identify and document 
      research related to shared decision-making and transitioning to long-term care. 
      METHODS: A comprehensive search in CINAHL, Medline and Psych-info identified 
      papers which included evidence of shared decision-making during transitions to a 
      long-term care setting. The review following the JBI and PAGER framework for 
      scoping reviews. Data were extracted, charted and analysed according to patterns, 
      advances, gaps, research recommendations and evidence for practice. RESULTS: 
      Eighteen papers met the inclusion criteria. A body of knowledge was identified 
      encompassing the pattern advancements in shared decision-making during 
      transitions to long-term care, representing developments in both the evidence 
      base and methodological approaches. Further patterns offer evidence of the 
      facilitators and barriers experienced by the person, their families and the 
      professional's involved. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence identified the complexity of 
      such decision-making with efforts to engage in shared decision-making often 
      constrained by the availability of resources, the skills of professionals and 
      time. The findings recognise the need for partnership and person-centred 
      approaches to optimise transitions. The review demonstrates evidence of 
      approaches that can inform future practice and research to support all adult 
      populations who may be faced with a transitional decision to actively participate 
      in decision-making.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore and characterize published evidence on the ways decision 
      analysis has been used to inform shared decision-making. STUDY DESIGN AND 
      SETTING: For this scoping review, we searched five bibliographic databases (from 
      inception until February 2021), reference lists of included studies, trial 
      registries, a thesis database and websites of relevant interest groups. Studies 
      were eligible if they evaluated the application of decision analysis in a shared 
      decision-making encounter. Pairs of reviewers independently screened and selected 
      studies for inclusion, extracted study information using a data extraction form 
      developed by the research team and assessed risk of bias for all studies with an 
      experimental or quasi-experimental design. Data were narratively synthesized. 
      RESULTS: We identified 27 studies that varied greatly with regard to their 
      patient population, design, content and delivery. A range of outcomes were 
      evaluated to explore the effectiveness and acceptability of decision analytic 
      interventions, with little information about the implementation process. Most 
      studies found that decision analysis was broadly beneficial. CONCLUSION: Despite 
      the compelling rationale on the potential for decision analysis to support shared 
      decision-making, rigorous randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm 
      these interventions' effectiveness, while qualitative studies should seek to 
      understand their potential implementation.

TI  - The description-experience gap: a challenge for the neuroeconomics of 
      decision-making under uncertainty.

AB  - The experimental investigation of decision-making in humans relies on two 
      distinct types of paradigms, involving either description- or experience-based 
      choices. In description-based paradigms, decision variables (i.e. payoffs and 
      probabilities) are explicitly communicated by means of symbols. In 
      experience-based paradigms decision variables are learnt from trial-by-trial 
      feedback. In the decision-making literature, 'description-experience gap' refers 
      to the fact that different biases are observed in the two experimental paradigms. 
      Remarkably, well-documented biases of description-based choices, such as 
      under-weighting of rare events and loss aversion, do not apply to 
      experience-based decisions. Here, we argue that the description-experience gap 
      represents a major challenge, not only to current decision theories, but also to 
      the neuroeconomics research framework, which relies heavily on the translation of 
      neurophysiological findings between human and non-human primate research. In 
      fact, most non-human primate neurophysiological research relies on behavioural 
      designs that share features of both description- and experience-based choices. As 
      a consequence, it is unclear whether the neural mechanisms built from non-human 
      primate electrophysiology should be linked to description-based or 
      experience-based decision-making processes. The picture is further complicated by 
      additional methodological gaps between human and non-human primate neuroscience 
      research. After analysing these methodological challenges, we conclude proposing 
      new lines of research to address them. This article is part of the theme issue 
      'Existence and prevalence of economic behaviours among non-human primates'.

TI  - Dynamic Decision Making: Learning Processes and New Research Directions.
PG  - 713-721
LID - 10.1177/0018720817710347 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this manuscript is to provide a review of contemporary 
      research and applications on dynamic decision making (DDM). BACKGROUND: Since 
      early DDM studies, there has been little systematic progress in understanding 
      decision making in complex, dynamic systems. Our review contributes to better 
      understanding of decision making processes in dynamic tasks. METHOD: We discuss 
      new research directions in DDM to highlight the value of simplification in the 
      study of complex decision processes, divided into experimental and 
      theoretical/computational approaches, and focus on problems involving control 
      tasks and search-and-choice tasks. In computational modeling, we discuss recent 
      developments in instance-based learning and reinforcement learning that advance 
      modeling the processes of dynamic decisions. RESULTS: Results from DDM research 
      reflect a trend to scale down the complexity of DDM tasks to facilitate the study 
      of the process of decision making. Recent research focuses on the dynamic 
      complexity emerging from the interactions of actions and outcomes over time even 
      in simple dynamic tasks. CONCLUSION: The study of DDM in theory and practice 
      continues to be a priority area of research. New research directions can help the 
      human factors community to understand the effects of experience, knowledge, and 
      adaption processes in DDM tasks, but research challenges remain to be addressed, 
      and the recent perspectives discussed can help advance a systematic DDM research 
      program. APPLICATION: Classical domains, such as automated pilot systems, 
      fighting fires, and medical emergencies, continue to be central applications of 
      basic DDM research, but new domains, such as cybersecurity, climate change, and 
      forensic science, are emerging as other important applications.
